## Fisher Boy ##

A while back Fischer-Price released a [Game Boy inspired baby toy](https://shopping.mattel.com/en-gb/products/laugh-and-learn-lil-gamer-hbc89-en-gb). 

It is the ideal candidate to mod it into an actual gaming console with a very simple PCB using the [RP2040 Stamp](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rp2040-stamp?variant=39567567028307)

The PCB needs to have a few things:

- the proper shape with a few "button patches" in the right place
- a USB port for charging
- a header for the SPI display 
- a connector for a LiPo battery
